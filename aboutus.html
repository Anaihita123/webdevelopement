      <h3>
      Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar believes that just information is not education. It is culturing our behavior and attitude. It is our ability to perceive things better. The purpose of education is to increase awareness. Only education that can nourish inbuilt virtues can impart true intelligence.
      With these thoughts in mind, SRI SRI RAVISHANKAR VIDYA MANDIR TRUST was founded in the year 1999 by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar as the educational wing of the Art of Living, to promote holistic education in a stress-free and child-friendly environment.</p>
